# Curriculum Vitae: David Stutz

This repository holds two LaTeX templates of my personal curriculum vitae as available on [http://davidstutz.de/author/david-stutz/](http://davidstutz.de/author/david-stutz/).

**Note:** You may use this as a template for your own curriculum vitae, however, any personal details including profile, education, teaching, work experience, research experience, service, interests, coursework and projects have to be removed or replaced.

## Simple Template

The simple template can be used for a minimalistic, two-page (one-column) curriculum vitae:

![Simple template.](simple.png?raw=true "Simple template")

## Two-Column Template

The two-column templates is inspired by the design of my personal webpage: [http://davidstutz.de/](http://davidstutz.de/). The Wordpress template of my webpage can also be found on GitHub: [https://github.com/davidstutz/wordpress-iamdavidstutz](https://github.com/davidstutz/wordpress-iamdavidstutz).
